The anti-recombinogenic functions of 53BP1 require phosphorylation-dependent interactions with PTIP and RIF1/shieldin effector complexes. While RIF1/shieldin blocks 5′-3′ nucleolytic processing of DNA ends, it remains unclear how PTIP antagonizes HR. Here, we show that mutation of the PTIP interaction site in 53BP1 (S25A) allows sufficient DNA2-dependent end resection to\xa0rescue the lethality of <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup> mice, despite increasing RIF1 “end-blocking” at DNA damage sites. However, double-mutant cells fail to complete HR, as excessive shieldin activity also inhibits RNF168-mediated loading of PALB2/RAD51. As a result, <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> mice exhibit hallmark features of HR insufficiency, including premature aging and hypersensitivity to PARPi.

Initially, BRCA1 promotes 5′-3′ end resection, and subsequently, it recruits the PALB2/BRCA2 mediator complex to load the RAD51 recombinase onto 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). In BRCA1-deficient cells, HR is severely compromised, leading to genome instability during development that precipitates tumorigenesis (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib13">Chen et\xa0al., 2018</a>). However, 53BP1 loss largely restores HR\xa0in BRCA1-deficient mice, resulting in the rescue of the embryonic lethality and the suppression of cancer predisposition in pre-clinical mouse tumor models (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib5">Bouwman et\xa0al., 2010</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib7">Bunting et\xa0al., 2010</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib12">Cao et\xa0al., 2009</a>). The dramatic rescue of HR in BRCA1-deficient mice is in part due to the role of 53BP1 in blocking end resection (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib7">Bunting et\xa0al., 2010</a>). However, in some cell lines, BRCA1 depletion had minimal effects on end processing under conditions in which RAD51 filament formation was compromised (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib55">Zhou et\xa0al., 2014</a>). RAD51 filament formation in BRCA1-deficient cells requires the alternative recruitment of PALB2/BRCA2 through RNF168-mediated chromatin ubiquitylation (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib57">Zong et\xa0al., 2019</a>). This raises the question of whether 53BP1, in addition to blocking resection, also antagonizes RNF168-driven RAD51 filament formation.</p><p id="p0035">The pro-end-joining and anti-recombination functions of 53BP1 require phospho-dependent interactions with downstream effectors such as RIF1 and PTIP (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib45">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</a>). Recently, independent laboratories have discovered components of a “shieldin complex,” which acts downstream of RIF1 to block resection (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib18">Dev et\xa0al., 2018</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib22">Findlay et\xa0al., 2018</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib23">Gao et\xa0al., 2018</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib24">Ghezraoui et\xa0al., 2018</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib26">Gupta et\xa0al., 2018</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib35">Mirman et\xa0al., 2018</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib38">Noordermeer et\xa0al., 2018</a>).

While FHA-PALB2 failed to rescue IR-induced RAD51 foci in resection-deficient <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup> cells, it restored RAD51 foci formation to WT levels in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> cells that are proficient in end resection (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>E and <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#mmc1">S5</a>E). Similarly, whereas FHA-PALB2 failed to mitigate PARPi sensitivity in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup> cells or enhance PARPi resistance in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>−/−</em></sup> cells, it markedly reduced the sensitivity of <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> cells to PARPi (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>F and 5G). PALB2 chromatin targeting also significantly reduced RIF1 foci formation (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig5">Figure\xa05</a>H), which is consistent with the idea that elevated RIF1/shieldin activity blocks PALB2 function in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> cells. Finally, the ability of FHA-PALB2 to rescue PARPi resistance and RAD51 foci formation in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> was dependent on its BRCA2-interaction domain (WD40) but not its chromatin association motif (ChAM) (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#mmc1">Figures S5</a>F and S5G), which is consistent with the idea that PALB2 recruits and is reliant on BRCA2 to assemble RAD51 (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib31">Kowalczykowski, 2015</a>).</p><p id="p0105">To directly examine RAD51 loading on ssDNA, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of ssDNA-bound RAD51 (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib6">Brick et\xa0al., 2018</a>) at AsiSI-cleaved sites. Consistent with immunofluorescence analyses, forced targeting of PALB2 to chromatin permitted RAD51 loading onto 3′ ssDNA in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> cells, while it did not nucleate RAD51 filaments at DSB sites in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup> cells (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>I and <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#mmc1">S5</a>H), presumably because of the lack of sufficient ssDNA. Thus, the post-resection HR defect in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> cells is caused by an inability to recruit PALB2/BRCA2 to damaged chromatin.</p></body></html>', 'Shieldin Interferes with the RNF168\xa0Ubiquitylation Pathway that Loads RAD51': '<html><body><p id="p0110">We have recently shown that in addition to its requirement for initiating 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs early after DNA damage, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 acts redundantly with BRCA1 to load PALB2/RAD51 on resected DNA ends (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib57">Zong et\xa0al., 2019</a>).

Although they interact with different phosphorylation sites on 53BP1, RIF1 and PTIP appear to partially occlude each other. This results in the observed increase in IRIF for RIF1 in <em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> mutant cells that are incapable of binding PTIP. Nevertheless, elevated RIF1/shieldin activity at DSBs is insufficient to inhibit end resection on its own. Long-range resection is normally mediated by a combination of EXO1 and DNA2, but it is catalyzed predominantly by DNA2 in PTIP-defective <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> cells (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>D and <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#mmc1">S6</a>) and by EXO1 in shieldin-defective <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>SHLD3</em><sup><em>−/−</em></sup> or <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup>/RIF1-depleted cells (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>E and <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#mmc1">S6</a>). Thus, mutually exclusive phosphorylation-mediated interactions with PTIP and RIF1/shieldin enable 53BP1 to independently suppress end resection by distinct nucleases.</p><p id="p0125">Although the loss of either 53BP1 effector restores end resection to normal levels in BRCA1-deficient cells, they differentially affect the downstream steps of HR. In <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> cells, the continued presence of shieldin on chromatin post-resection greatly reduces the loading of RAD51 on ssDNA\xa0(<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#mmc1">Figure\xa0S6</a>). Defective RAD51 loading may in turn promote further hyperresection in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> cells. Inefficient RAD51 filament assembly is apparently sufficient to\xa0rescue the prenatal lethality associated with <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup> mutation, but it is inadequate to support the normal lifespan in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> mice, even though the cancer rate is not markedly increased. These phenotypes are reminiscent of dominant-negative RAD51 mutations found in Fanconi anemia, which do\xa0not produce the typical features of bone marrow failure or cancer predisposition, but instead cause neuronal defects, microcephaly, and sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib2">Ameziane et\xa0al., 2015</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib49">Takenaka et\xa0al., 2019</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib51">Wang et\xa0al., 2015</a>).</p><p id="p0130">How does 53BP1/shieldin block RAD51 filament assembly? RAD51 recombinase activity is facilitated by numerous proteins, including BRCA2, RAD54, and the family of RAD51 paralogs, which act at different stages of HR (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib31">Kowalczykowski, 2015</a>). BRCA2 must first displace RPA from resected DNA ends to enable the subsequent deposition of RAD51 on ssDNA (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib31">Kowalczykowski, 2015</a>). Shieldin, RPA, and BRCA2/PALB2 are\xa0OB fold-containing complexes with ssDNA-binding activity (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib45">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</a>). An interesting possibility is that RPA and shieldin may form mixed polymers on ssDNA. Although BRCA2 has a higher affinity for ssDNA than RPA, it is possible that BRCA2 cannot efficiently displace shieldin to allow the nucleation of the RAD51 filament. We show that forced targeting of SHLD2 to DSBs is inhibitory to the replacement of RPA by RAD51 (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig5">Figure\xa05</a>C). Nevertheless, the block in HR in <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> cells, associated with the elevation of RIF1/shieldin activity, can be overcome by forced PALB2 loading to chromatin (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>E–5H) in a manner dependent on the interaction of PALB2 with BRCA2 (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#mmc1">Figures S5</a>F and S5G). In <em>BRCA1</em>-deficient cells, the recruitment of PALB2/BRCA2 to ssDNA is dependent on RNF168-driven H2A-K15 ubiquitylation (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib57">Zong et\xa0al., 2019</a>). Our data thus suggest that shieldin binding to resected ends can directly compete with RNF168, leading to defective PALB2 accrual, which prevents the nucleation of RAD51 filaments (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#mmc1">Figure\xa0S6</a>). However, a more direct role of shieldin in antagonizing BRCA2 activity cannot be discounted.</p><p id="p0135">The post-resection anti-recombination functions of 53BP1 described herein may be relevant to the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in a subset of <em>BRCA1</em>-mutated tumors. Germline pathogenic mutations in the RING domain, exemplified by the 185delAG founder mutation commonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, are associated with breast and ovarian cancers and predict poor responses to chemotherapy (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib20">Drost et\xa0al., 2016</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib52">Wang et\xa0al., 2016</a>). Therapy resistance in this setting has been linked to the overexpression of the hypomorphic RING-less BRCA1 protein, and is associated with partially recovered RAD51 loading and HR (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib20">Drost et\xa0al., 2016</a>, <a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib52">Wang et\xa0al., 2016</a>). By contrast, we found that non-cancerous cells expressing RING-less BRCA1 at physiological levels, despite robust end resection, are highly defective in RAD51 loading (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig7">Figures 7</a>), which can be corrected by the loss of 53BP1 (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib57">Zong et\xa0al., 2019</a>). We therefore propose that when the RING-less BRCA1 is overexpressed in cancers, its residual hypomorphic activity is able to partially overcome 53BP1/shieldin binding to resected DNA ends, leading to the partial restoration of HR and the development of chemotherapy resistance.</p><p id="p0140">In summary, the expression of 53BP1<sup>S25A</sup> on a <em>BRCA1</em> mutant background produces a striking uncoupling of end resection from downstream RAD51 loading and suggests that embryonic viability requires end resection but not necessarily efficient HR.

Briefly, the left homology arm consisting of 5.1 kB of sequence prior to exon 2 of 53BP1 was inserted into an Entry clone using Gateway recombinational cloning (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA) and flanked by Gateway attB4 and attB1 sites. The right homology arm consisting of exon 2 with an embedded S25A mutation and 3.1 kB of downstream homologous DNA in the subsequent intron was constructed using overlap extension PCR to introduce the appropriate mutation (TCT to GCT) and flanked by Gateway attB2 and attB3 sequences. Homology arm clones were sequenced in their entirety to ensure that no PCR mutations were introduced during amplification. Validated clones were used in a Multisite Gateway recombination reaction along with a selection cassette consisting of an attB1-attB2 flanked reverse orientation PGK promoter-neomycin resistance-BgH polyA fragment and introduced into a Gateway pUC19 destination vector with flanking attR4 and attR3 sites. The final targeting clone consists of the 9.1 kB sequence: left homology arm-(pA-neo-PGK)-exon 2 S25A-right homology arm and is flanked by NotI sites for release of the transgene from the vector backbone. Two derivative targeted ES clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. The resultant chimeric offspring was backcrossed with wild-type C57BL/6 mice, producing <em>53BP1</em><sup><em>+/S25A</em></sup> animals. Germline transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed by PCR (forward primer: 5′ ggagatggctgagaaagtgc 3′; reverse primer: 5′ tcccctggaatggaataaca 3′). The PGK-neo cassette was removed by crossing to β-actin-Cre transgenic mice (Jackson Laboratory). <em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>+/Δ11</em></sup> mice were obtained from the NCI mouse repository. <em>53BP1</em><sup><em>−/−</em></sup> mice were a gift from Junjie Chen. <em>p53</em><sup><em>−/−</em></sup> mice were obtained from Taconic Biosciences.

Extract was spun down at 14,000\xa0rpm for 30\xa0minutes and the soluble material was dialyzed in BC100 buffer (20\xa0mM Tris pH 7.3, 100\xa0mM KCl, 0.2\xa0mM EDTA, 20% Glycerol, 0.2\xa0mM PMSF, 1\xa0mM β-mercaptoethanol). 53BP1 complex was purified from the nuclear extract using anti-Flag (M2) resin (Sigma), followed by purification using anti-HA (F-7) resin (Santa Cruz) in TAP buffer (50\xa0mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 100\xa0mM KCl, 5\xa0mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 1\xa0mM DTT, and protease inhibitors). For both Flag and HA purifications, nuclear extract was rotated with resin for 4 hours, washed extensively with TAP buffer, and eluted with 0.4\xa0mg/mL of Flag or HA peptide (Sigma). After elution, the complex was TCA precipitated and associated proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher) and Sequest software.</p><p id="p0225"><em>BRCA1</em><sup><em>Δ11</em></sup><em>53BP1</em><sup><em>S25A</em></sup> and WT littermate control mice were administered PARPi (AZD2281) prepared in 10% DMSO/90% Captisol via oral gavage. Mice were treated with 40\xa0mg/kg of PARPi daily in a volume of approximately 100\xa0μl and monitored daily for changes in health status following PARPi treatment. H&amp;E staining was routinely performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Gut rolls of the small intestine, cecum, and large intestine were digitized with an Aperio ScanScope XT (Leica) at 200\xa0× in a single z-plane. Aperio whole-slide images were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist.</p><p id="p0230">Sections were photographed at 10\xa0× magnification. Mice were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), while embryos were drop-fixed in 4% PFA and tissues were cryoprotected in 25% PBS-buffered sucrose solution, embedded in O.C.T. and sectioned sagittally at 10\xa0μm using an HM500M cryostat (Microm). Immunohistochemistry was performed after antigen retrieval. Antibodies used were: anti-Tbr1 (1:250; Synaptic Systems #328005) and anti-phospho KAP1(Ser-824) (1:500; Bethyl Labs, #A300-767A). Immunostaining of active caspase-3 was visualized with a VIP substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) and biotinylated secondary antibody and avidin-biotin complex (Vectastain Elite kit; Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with 0.1% methyl green (Vector Laboratories), dehydrated and mounted with DPX (Fluka). For fluorescence detection, FITC or Cy3 conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunologicals) were used and nuclei were counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or propidium iodide (Vector Laboratories). TUNEL staining was done using the ApopTag system (Chemicon).</p><p id="p0235">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 7\xa0T Bruker ClinScan system (Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH, Germany) equipped with 12S gradient coil. A two-channel surface coil was used for MR imaging. Animals were anesthetized and maintained with 1.5%–2% isoflurane during MRI sessions. Data analysis was done by manually segmenting the regions and computing volumes using OsiriX (v5.7, Pixmeo, Switzerland).</p><p id="p0240">For the kyphosis study, mice were imaged in the prone position for a 3-bed position X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) (Inveon Multi-Modality PET/CT, Siemens Medical Solutions, Knoxville, TN). X-ray CT step and shoot acquisition parameters were: 80 kVp, 500\xa0μA, 1000\xa0msec per step, 180 steps covering 360-degrees. X-ray CT images were reconstructed using a Feldkamp cone beam algorithm with a Shepp-Logan smoothing filter resulting in 512\xa0× 512\xa0× 1170 matrix (0.08\xa0× 0.08\xa0× 0.08\xa0μm pixel size). Images were linearly calibrated to Hounsfield units (air: −1000 HU, water: 0 HU). The X-ray CT 3D images (orthogonal axial, coronal, and sagittal views) were displayed using a medical image viewer (MIM v 6.6.5, MIM Software Inc, Cleveland, OH) and a pseudo-3D maximum intensity projection (MIP) was implemented to rotate and translate the mouse into perpendicular orientation for analysis</p><p id="p0245">A retrovirus encoding AsiSI (pTRE3G-HA-ER-AsiSI) was stably transduced into the indicated MEF cell lines as previously described (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib10">Canela et\xa0al., 2016</a>). Exponentially growing AsiSI-expressing MEFs were treated with 1\xa0μM doxocyclin (DOX) for 24 hours and then, for 5 hours with 4-OHT, resulting in the nuclear translocation of AsiSI. MEFs were harvested and 9 million cells were embedded in agarose plugs, after which END-seq was performed as described (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib11">Canela et\xa0al., 2017</a>). END-seq reads were aligned to the mouse (GRCm38p2/mm10) genomes using Bowtie (version 1.1.2) (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib32">Langmead et\xa0al., 2009</a>) with parameters -n 3 -k 1 -l 50.</p><p id="p0250">Break intensity was measured by integrating the RPKM values within 100\xa0bp of each AsiSI break site. To quantify the width of maximum resection endpoint (in bp), a sliding window containing twenty 100\xa0bp bins was used, starting from the AsiSI site out to 20 kb to the right side. When more than half of the bins within this sliding window had an RPKM value equal to or lower than the background, then the last bin within the window with a detectable signal over background was regarded as the maximum resection endpoint. Background was determined by the maximum END-seq signal for 100\xa0bp bins more than 20 kb (within 20 kb-30 kb) away from individual AsiSI sites.</p><p id="p0255">To map ssDNA bound by RAD51 and RPA at AsiSI sites (ChIP-SSDS), we first captured DNA bound by RAD51 or RPA. Twenty million cells were harvested for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-RAD51 (Abcam #176458, 10\xa0μg/sample) or anti-RPA antibody (Abcam #10359, 10\xa0μg/sample). ssDNA that spontaneously forms hairpins after heat renaturation was then enriched and sequenced as described (<a class="workspace-trigger" href="#bib6">Brick et\xa0al., 2018</a>).</p><p id="p0260">Unless indicated, all data are presented as individual replicates.
