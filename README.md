# PyRead

This project aims to create a uniform platform for storing, organizing and reading academic literature through a web browser.

First, we are working a local server based on the aiohttp module in python and a vanilla javascript frontend.

Ultimately, users may find it convenient to use a remote server, so that may come later.
